# Book-Library
In this small project, I will be creating a simple library that stores all the books of your choice. Each book will have the feature of adding the author, book name, number of pages, and a checkbox that lets you mark whether you have read it or not. You can add as many book as you want. I will be incorporating 3 technologies: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I have added another feature into the project: a remove button that will remove that book from the library.

Things that I have improved in this project: I have put my main block of code inside a function called main, and then call that function at the very last line of my code, which looks way more clean than it was before with the previous project. I also used a class called Book to store all the info into, and not just create a new variable every time a new book is created. 

Things that I need to improved on the next project: I need to spend more time planning the structure of the project. Some className and id were all over the place. Fortunately, I was able to manuever around that in this project.

Hurdles I encountered during this project: creating a function object as illustrated in the ODIN project and coding setter functions inside it is quite hard. I spent quite some time trying to figure out the solution without success. So, I went ahead and borrow some knowledge from my CS112 class at Rutgers (such as creating a class for Book, instead of just the object function). After that, it was a smooth road down.
