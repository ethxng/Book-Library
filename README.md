# Book-Library
In this small project, I will be creating a simple library that stores all the books of your choice. Each book will have the feature of adding the author, book name, number of pages, and whether you have read it or not. You can add as many book as you want. I will be incorporating 3 technologies: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
